\section{Methodology}

Our methodology focuses on building a Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network as a proposed improvement. The approach can be summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Preprocessing:} Clean the dataset by handling missing values, normalize numerical features using MinMaxScaler, and split the data into training and testing sets.
    
    \item \textbf{Branch Network Design:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Branch-1 processes long-term historical data (features spanning past 5+ years).
        \item Branch-2 processes short-term recent data (features spanning past 1-2 years).
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Feature Extraction:} Each branch uses dense layers to extract hierarchical feature representations.

    \item \textbf{Feature Fusion:} Outputs of both branches are concatenated into a single vector.

    \item \textbf{Prediction:} The fused feature vector is passed through a few fully connected layers to produce the final predicted house price.
    
    \item \textbf{Optimization:} The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function.
\end{itemize}

This multi-branch strategy allows the model to focus better on different types of temporal dynamics separately, leading to improved overall performance.
